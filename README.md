## About

In this repository, you'll find a collection of coding challenges, problems, and projects that I've tackled. These challenges span various domains, including algorithms, data structures, web development, and more. Whether I'm brushing up on my skills or exploring new concepts, this repository serves as a learning resource and a personal coding playground.

## Challenges

Here's a glimpse of what you'll find:

- **Algorithms**: Implementations of classic algorithms and data structures.
- **Web Development**: Small web projects and frontend/backend coding tasks.
- **Coding Puzzles**: Fun and brain-teasing coding puzzles and games.
- **Interview Questions**: Practice for technical interviews with real-world problems.

Each challenge or project typically comes with its own README file, where you can find details about the problem, my approach, and the code.

## Contributing

I encourage contributions! If you have a coding challenge you'd like to share or if you spot an issue or improvement in my solutions, please feel free to create a pull request or open an issue. Let's learn and grow together!
